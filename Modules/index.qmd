This is a 15 week course, with roughly 14 modules. The practical goal of the course is to train a broad base of data-analysis and visualization skills using open-source software tools like R.

The modules roughly track the ten chapters of the textbook:

In general, modules will contain a reading, additional resources, and a weekly assignment.

The modules will be updated across the semester as needed.
