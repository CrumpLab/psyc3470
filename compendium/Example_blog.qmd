In this class you will be contributing posts to a quarto blog to complete weekly assignments. It can be very helpful to see examples of working code as you learn about quarto. To help with this I created an example blog with lots of example code. If you have requests about examples to add please let me know.

The source code can be found here:

<https://github.com/CrumpLab/CrumplabExampleBlog>

The blog is viewable here:

<https://crumplab.com/CrumplabExampleBlog/>

I will be mostly making posts for PSYC 3470 in this blog, but sometimes I may add posts with examples for students in other classes.
