See the example code at the end of this document for more examples of working ggplot2 scripts.

## Data-vis assignment

This assignment contains several figures that were recently published in the January 2019 issue of Psychological Science. Although, this sample of figures is somewhat arbitrary, they represent a decent range of figures that are produced in Psychological research. Notably, the look and feel of these graphs suggests that that they were all made in R using the ggplot2 package. And even if they weren't, they can all be made in ggplot2.

Your task is to write code to reproduce each of the graphs using ggplot2. You do not have the original data for any of these graphs, and your job is to make inferences about what the data must have been. For each graph you will create a data.frame to mimic the data you see in the graph, and then use ggplot2 to make the plot. 

By the end of this exercise you will become much more familiar with how ggplot2 works, and you will have created several examples of working ggplot2 scripts that you can use for making graphs in the future.
