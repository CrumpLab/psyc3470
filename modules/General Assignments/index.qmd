## GA3: Do a tidy tuesday

Usefulness: VERY HIGH

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly challenge to wrangle some data in R and produce a data-visualization. There is a new dataset every Tuesday, and an archive of past datasets. 

The official repository for everything Tidy Tuesday is <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday>.

There is also a podcast <https://www.tidytuesday.com> by the R4DS (R for Data science) online learning community.

This assignment involves doing a Tidy Tuesday challenge and posting your analysis on your blog. Get the data, figure out how to wrangle it for your intended data-visualization, then create a visualization of the data that is useful for "seeing" patterns in the data.
