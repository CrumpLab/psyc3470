See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\n\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.\nIf you have questions please email me:\n\nput Seminar 2 in your subject line\nemail me at: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n\n\n\n\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of each student to understand and act in accordance with the University’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nThe faculty and administration of Brooklyn College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found at this site. If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.\n\n\n\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CUNY’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\n\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about the syllabus, let’s talk about it in class, and/or please create a thread to discuss the question on the discussion board for this course on Blackboard."
