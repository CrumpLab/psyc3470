The link is:\nhttps://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog\nThe instructions for using this with posit cloud are contained in the repository, just keep scrolling down in the readme.md. The instructions are also re-printed here, along with a video tutorial.\n\n\n\nSign up for a free account with posit cloud here https://posit.cloud/plans/free\nSign up for a free https://github.com account.\nLog in to Github, and search for this repository https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog.\n\n\nClick the green “Use this template” Button\nThis will make a copy of the template in your github account, it will show up as one of your repositories\nGive your new repository a name\n\n\nActivate Github pages for your repository (under repository settings), and serve the page from the “docs” folder. You should now be able to view the blog from the url given by github pages.\nLog into Posit Cloud\nCreate a New Project, choose “New Project from Git Repository”\n\n\nenter the URL to the github repository you just made\n\n\nLoad the project, and edit/modify the files (see above for examples of creating new posts etc.)\nTo send your changed files back to github.com you need to do a few steps\n\n\nFrom the Git tab: stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes using the green up arrow.\nYou will also need to authenticate your git credentials, and allow Rstudio cloud to update your github repository\nIn the terminal run these two lines, but replace with your name and email\n\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n\nWhen you “push” your changes back to Github using the green up arrow, you will be asked to enter a username and password. You can enter the username for your Github.com account, but your password won’t work. You need to set up a personal access token.\nGo to your github.com profile > settings page. Scroll down, click on “<> Developer Settings”, on the left\nClick on personal access tokens, generate a new token, give it repo access. Save the text somewhere and use it as your github password when pushing from RStudio.\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to work on your blog in Rstudio Cloud, and push your changes to have them updated on github.com, which serves your blog online."

This way I can help you assess and improve your own work. Next, I describe some possibilities for public and private sharing so that you can hand in your assignments and I can check them efficiently.\nNote, most of the assignments in this class involve producing working code in a reproducible document, like a blog entry containing working R code for a graph, table, or other behavior. As a result, the ability to “render” or compile the document becomes an important quality check for the work. If the document does not compile, then something is definitely not working. If the document does compile, then you can see the evidence that it is working (e.g., you can see the correct output on your blog). As a result, the gold-standard for each assignment is to submit a working output, and often times a correctly published blog post is part of this demonstration.\nIn other words, when I am assessing your work I want to see that you can compile your own documents. Below I describe some options for this in public or private modes of sharing your work with me."

To work in this mode students will create and maintain local folders with their code (on their computer, or on posit cloud), and they will publish them in public repositories on github.com. Students who do this will submit URLs to their github.com assets on Blackboard for each assignment.\nFor example, if you successfully published a quarto blog and you can view the source code on github.com, and view the published blog as a website, you would be able to submit both URLs on blackboard, and I would be able to immediately see what is working or not.\nRemember, anything you put out on github.com in a public folder is publicly viewable by anyone on the internet."

I will not share your user name or repository information. In this method you sign up with an account that does not reveal your identity, and you work in public repositories that you share with me on blackboard.\n\n\nPrivate github.com repositories\nIt is possible to set a github.com repository to “private”. In this case the repository will only be accessible to you or other collaborators that you give access to. If you do this, then I will request access to your repository so that I can check your work. In this method, you would still submit links to your work on github, but only people with access to your repository would be able to view the links\n\n\nposit cloud\nYou could use posit cloud for this class, which allows you to run R studio in your web-browser. Posit cloud projects are private by default. However, it is possible to share access privileges with other people. So, you could share your posit cloud account with me, and submit your work by sharing the link to your R studio project on posit cloud\n\n\nother methods\nThere are potentially several other methods that we could explore. For example, you could .zip a folder of your code and upload it directly to a blackboard assignment. We can discuss other methods if necesssary in class."

    "text": "Variables\na is the variable name. <- is the assignment operator. In this example, 1 is being assigned into the object named a.\n\na <- 1\n\nVariables have classes that describe their contents.\n\nx <- 1\nclass(x)\n#> [1] \"numeric\"\n\ny <- \"1\"\nclass(y)\n#> [1] \"character\"\n\nz <- TRUE\nclass(z)\n#> [1] \"logical\"\n\nClasses allow and disallow some commands.

The number of elements in the vector is the vector length. Manipulating vectors involves creating them, and storing, retrieving, and changing elements inside of the vector.\n\nVector Creation\nThere are multiple ways to create a vector\n\na <- c() # create a NULL vector\na\n#> NULL\n\na <- 1:5 # assign a sequence to a name\na\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\na <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # assign a vector made with combine c()\na\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n#pre-assign an empty vector\na <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = 10)\na\n#>  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\na <- vector(mode = \"integer\", length = 10)\na\n#>  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\na <- vector(mode = \"logical\", length = 10)\na\n#>  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\na <- vector(mode = \"character\", length = 10)\na\n#>  [1] \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\n\nlength() returns the number of elements in the vector\n\na <- c(1,4,5)\nlength(a)\n#> [1] 3\n\n\n\nVector Combination\nIt is possible to combine existing vectors together to make a new vector using c().\n\nx <- 1:5\ny <- 6:10\n\nx\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\ny\n#> [1]  6  7  8  9 10\n\nz <- c(x,y)\nz\n#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nHowever, if you attempt to combine vectors of different classes, R will throw an error, or it will coerce (convert) one of the vectors into the class of the other.\n\nx <- 1:5\ny <- c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\")\n\nx\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\ny\n#> [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\"\n\nz <- c(x,y)\nz\n#>  [1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\"\n\n\n\nVector Indexing\nVector indexing is the the process of isolating specific positions or elements of a vector. Vector indexing uses the [] notation.\nThe general syntax is vector_name[positions], where vector_name is the name of your vector, and positions is a vector of positions to index.\n\na <- c(23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89)\n\na[1] # returns the element in position 1\n#> [1] 23\n\na[1:3] # returns elements in positions 1 to 3\n#> [1] 23 34 45\n\na[c(4, 5, 6)]\n#> [1] 56 67 78\n\na[c(1, 1, 1)]\n#> [1] 23 23 23\n\nLogical vectors can indicate positions. In this case, elements in TRUE positions will be returned\n\na <- c(45, 56, 78)\n\na[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]\n#> [1] 45\n\na[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]\n#> [1] 56\n\na[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]\n#> [1] 78\n\n\n\nVector indexing and assignment\nVector indexing can also be used to assign new elements to the indexed positions.\n\na <- c(45, 56, 78)\na\n#> [1] 45 56 78\n\na[3] <- 100\na\n#> [1]  45  56 100\n\na[1:3] <- \"Hello\"\na\n#> [1] \"Hello\" \"Hello\" \"Hello\"\n\n\n\nLogical indexing\nVectors can be indexing using logical comparisons (see section on logic for further explanation and examples of logical comparisons).\n\na <- c(1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4)\n\na == 4 # create logical vector of positions containing 4\n#> [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n# inserting the above into a[] finds the elements equal to 4\na[a == 4] # elements equal to 4\n#> [1] 4 4\n\na[a < 4] # elements less than 4\n#> [1] 1 3 2 3\n\na[a <= 4] # elements less than or equal to 4\n#> [1] 1 3 2 4 3 4\n\na[a != 1] # elements not equal to 1\n#> [1] 3 2 4 3 4\n\n\n\n\nData.frame\nData.frames are 2-d storage objects, like a table (or excel sheet), they have columns and rows.\n\na <- data.frame() # make an empty data.frame\na\n#> data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows\nclass(a)\n#> [1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nData.frame creation\nA common method to create a data.frame involves adding existing vectors together. Data.frames are often also created when loading in data files that are 2-d tables. See also the section on using dplyr to manipulate data in dataframes. Data.frames are also similar to data.tables, and tibbles, and can usually be interchanged.\n\nx <- c(1, 2, 3)\ny <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nz <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\n\na <- data.frame(x, y, z)\na\n#>   x y    z\n#> 1 1 a TRUE\n#> 2 2 b TRUE\n#> 3 3 c TRUE\n\ndim() returns the number of rows and columns in the data.frame\n\ndim(a)\n#> [1] 3 3\n\n\n\nIndexing by column name\nEach column in a data.frame has a name, and can be accessed using the $ syntax:\n\nnames(a)\n#> [1] \"x\" \"y\" \"z\"\n\na$x\n#> [1] 1 2 3\n\na$y\n#> [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\na$z\n#> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n#re-name by assigning a new vector\nnames(a) <- c(\"new_x\", \"Why\", \"Zee\")\na\n#>   new_x Why  Zee\n#> 1     1   a TRUE\n#> 2     2   b TRUE\n#> 3     3   c TRUE\n\na$new_x\n#> [1] 1 2 3\na$Why\n#> [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\na$Zee\n#> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\nIndexing with [rows,columns]\nData.frames have rows and columns, and can be indexed using [rows,columns] notation, where rows is a vector of row numbers, and columns is a vector of column numbers\n\na\n#>   new_x Why  Zee\n#> 1     1   a TRUE\n#> 2     2   b TRUE\n#> 3     3   c TRUE\n\na[1, ] # row 1\n#>   new_x Why  Zee\n#> 1     1   a TRUE\n\na[, 1] # column 1\n#> [1] 1 2 3\n\na[1:2, ] # rows 1 to 2\n#>   new_x Why  Zee\n#> 1     1   a TRUE\n#> 2     2   b TRUE\n\na[, 1:2] # columns 1 to 2\n#>   new_x Why\n#> 1     1   a\n#> 2     2   b\n#> 3     3   c\n\na[1:2, 1:2] #rows 1 to 2 and columns 1 to 2\n#>   new_x Why\n#> 1     1   a\n#> 2     2   b\n\na[1:2, 'new_x'] # Column names can be used\n#> [1] 1 2\n\n\n\nrow and column binding\nIt is possible to add more rows using rbind(), and add more columns using cbind().\n\n# row bind a copy of a to itself\na\n#>   new_x Why  Zee\n#> 1     1   a TRUE\n#> 2     2   b TRUE\n#> 3     3   c TRUE\na <- rbind(a, a)\ndim(a)\n#> [1] 6 3\n\n# create a new vector, add it as a new column\nmy_new <- c(1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5)\na <- cbind(a, my_new)\na\n#>   new_x Why  Zee my_new\n#> 1     1   a TRUE      1\n#> 2     2   b TRUE      4\n#> 3     3   c TRUE      3\n#> 4     1   a TRUE      2\n#> 5     2   b TRUE      4\n#> 6     3   c TRUE      5\n\n\n\nIndexing and assignment\nThe elements in a data.frame can be re-assigned by your_dataframe[row:position] <- new stuff. It is generally necessary that any new elements have the same class as the original elements\n\na\n#>   new_x Why  Zee my_new\n#> 1     1   a TRUE      1\n#> 2     2   b TRUE      4\n#> 3     3   c TRUE      3\n#> 4     1   a TRUE      2\n#> 5     2   b TRUE      4\n#> 6     3   c TRUE      5\n\na[, 1] <- 5 #assign column 1 all 5s\n\na$Why <- c(\"new\", \"words\", \"are\", \"going\", \"in\", \"here\")\na\n#>   new_x   Why  Zee my_new\n#> 1     5   new TRUE      1\n#> 2     5 words TRUE      4\n#> 3     5   are TRUE      3\n#> 4     5 going TRUE      2\n#> 5     5    in TRUE      4\n#> 6     5  here TRUE      5\n\na[6, 3] <- FALSE # row 6, column 3\na\n#>   new_x   Why   Zee my_new\n#> 1     5   new  TRUE      1\n#> 2     5 words  TRUE      4\n#> 3     5   are  TRUE      3\n#> 4     5 going  TRUE      2\n#> 5     5    in  TRUE      4\n#> 6     5  here FALSE      5\n\n\n\nLogical indexing\nIt is also possible to index a data.frame with logical comparisons. For example, the following returns rows where the value in column my_new equals a 4\n\na[a$my_new == 4, ]\n#>   new_x   Why  Zee my_new\n#> 2     5 words TRUE      4\n#> 5     5    in TRUE      4\n\n\n\n\nLists\nLists are objects that can store more arbitrary elements of any class, including vectors, dataframes, and even more lists. Lists are commonly used to store results from a model, especially when the model returns many different kinds of results in different formats.\nHere we create a list with three elements, a scalar, a vector, and a dataframe.\n\nx <- 1\ny <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nz <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 1:5, c = 1:5)\nmy_list <- list(x, y, z)\n\nmy_list\n#> [[1]]\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n#> \n#> [[3]]\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n\n\nList indexing\nAccess elements in the list using [[]]\n\nmy_list[[1]]\n#> [1] 1\n\nmy_list[[2]]\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nmy_list[[3]]\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\nNamed elements\nElements in a list can be given names, and indexed by name:\n\nx <- 1\ny <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nz <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 1:5, c = 1:5)\nmy_list <- list(ex = x, why = y, zee =  z)\n\nmy_list\n#> $ex\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> $why\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n#> \n#> $zee\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n\nmy_list$ex\n#> [1] 1\nmy_list$why\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\nmy_list$zee\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n\nmy_list[[\"ex\"]]\n#> [1] 1\nmy_list[[\"why\"]]\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\nmy_list[[\"zee\"]]\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\nAdd/Remove elements in lists\nIt is possible to assign new names elements to a list, e.g.:\n\nmy_list[[\"new_thing\"]] <- 12345\n\nmy_list\n#> $ex\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> $why\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n#> \n#> $zee\n#>   a b c\n#> 1 1 1 1\n#> 2 2 2 2\n#> 3 3 3 3\n#> 4 4 4 4\n#> 5 5 5 5\n#> \n#> $new_thing\n#> [1] 12345\n\n#set an element to NULL removes it\nmy_list[[\"zee\"]] <- NULL\n\nmy_list\n#> $ex\n#> [1] 1\n#> \n#> $why\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5\n#> \n#> $new_thing\n#> [1] 12345"

IF the person is taller than the line, then they can go on the ride; ELSE (otherwise) the person can not go on the ride.\nIn other words, IF the situation is X, then do something; ELSE (if the situation is not X), then do something different.\nIF and ELSE statements let us specify the conditions when specific actions are taken. Generally, IF and ELSE statements are used inside loops (for, or while, or repeat loops), because at each step or iteration of the loop, we want to check something, and then do something.\nConsider this:\n\na <- 1 # define a to be a 1\nif (a == 1) {\n  print(a) # this is what happens if a==1\n} else {\n  print(\"A is not 1\") # this is what happens if a is not 1\n}\n#> [1] 1\n\n\na <- 2 # define a to be a 1\nif (a == 1) {\n  print(a) # this is what happens if a==1\n} else {\n  print(\"A is not 1\") # this is what happens if a is not 1\n}\n#> [1] \"A is not 1\"\n\nNormally we find IF and ELSE in a loop like this:\n\na <- c(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) # make a variable contain 1s and 0s\n\n# write a loop to check each element in the variable\n# and do different things depending on the element\n\nfor (i in a) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    print(\"I'm a 1\") # what to do when i is 1\n  } else {\n    print(\"I'm not a 1\") # what to do when i is not 1\n  }\n}\n#> [1] \"I'm a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n#> [1] \"I'm a 1\"\n\nWe can have multiple conditions in our if statements.

    "text": "Loops\nCheck R help for on Control Flow ?Control.\nfor(){} for(loop control){do something each iteration}\n\nfor(iterator in vector) {\n  #do something\n}\n\nLoop control is defined in between the parentheses. The name of the iterator is placed on the left of in(can be assigned any name you want, does not need to be declared in advance). During the execution of the loop, the iterator takes on the values inside the vector which is placed on the right side of in. Specifically, the following is happening.\nLoop steps: 1. iterator <- vector[1] 2. iterator <- vector[2] 3. iterator <- vector[3] 4. etc.\nThe loop will automatically stop once it reaches the last item in the vector. The loop can be stopped before that using the break command.\n\n# Make a loop do something 5 times\n# i is the iterator\n# 1:5 creates a vector with 5 numbers in it, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n# the loop will run 5 times, because there are five things to assign to i\nfor(i in 1:5) {\n  print(\"hello\")\n}\n#> [1] \"hello\"\n#> [1] \"hello\"\n#> [1] \"hello\"\n#> [1] \"hello\"\n#> [1] \"hello\"\n\n\n# show the value of i each step of the loop\nfor(i in 1:5) {\n  print(i)\n}\n#> [1] 1\n#> [1] 2\n#> [1] 3\n#> [1] 4\n#> [1] 5\n\n\n# define the vector to loop over in advance\nx <- 1:5\nfor (i in x) {\n  print(i)\n}\n#> [1] 1\n#> [1] 2\n#> [1] 3\n#> [1] 4\n#> [1] 5\n\n\n# Reminder that i becomes the next value in the vector\n# your vector can have any order \nmy_sequence <- c(1, 5, 2, 3, 4)\nfor (i in my_sequence) {\n  print(i)\n}\n#> [1] 1\n#> [1] 5\n#> [1] 2\n#> [1] 3\n#> [1] 4\n\n\n# index vector does not need to be numbers\nmy_things <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\nfor (i in my_things) {\n  print(i)\n}\n#> [1] \"A\"\n#> [1] \"B\"\n#> [1] \"C\"\n#> [1] \"D\"\n\n\nBreaking a loop\nbreak stops a loop.

Latex is also free and cross-platform, however a complete installation is can be quite large.\nI think the advice by Frederick Aust (an author of the papaja package) for installing latex is worth following:\n\nhttps://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started\n\nBasically, the advice is to install a complete tex distribution (follow the above for links), or to use the tinytex package in R. The tinytex package should be sufficient for most knitting to pdf duties.\n\nInstall the tinytex library:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\n\nRun this command after installing the library\n\ntinytex::install_tex()\n\n\nknitr options\nWhen you create a new R Markdown document you will see the following code chunk underneath the yaml, at the beginning of the document. It usually looks like this:\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\nThis chunk is named setup, it is not printed in your output, but it controls the global setup options for the whole document. Any option you set here applies to all of the remaining code chunks you create. It’s a way of setting defaults.\nHere are some helpful defaults you can add. You turn the option on with TRUE, and turn it off with FALSE.\n\necho=TRUE sets the default to print all remaining code blocks to the output, FALSE sets the default to not print the code blocks\nwarning = FALSE turns off printing of warnings\nmessage = FALSE turns off printing of messages, these commonly occur when you load a package, where you receive a message that the package was loaded\neval = FALSE sets the default to NOT evaluate the code chunk as R Code. This will not run the code block, but the code block will still print if echo=TRUE\nerror=TRUE normally the knit fails when there is an error in the code. If you set error=TRUE the knit will complete, and return an error message for code blocks with errors.\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,\n                      warning = FALSE,\n                      message = FALSE, \n                      eval = FALSE,\n                      error = TRUE)\n```\n\n\nknitr figure output defaults\nThe following setup options are useful for figure output.\n\nfig.width = 3 sets the default width in inches for all figures\nfig.height = 3 sets the default height in inches for all figures\nfig.path = \"myfigs/\" defines folder where figure files will be saved. This will be relative to your current working directoy\ndev = c(\"pdf\", \"png\") tells knitr to output both .png, and .pdf versions of the figure. The .pdf contains vector graphics, meaning the figure can be resized without pixelization.\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,\n                      fig.width = 3,\n                      fig.height = 3,\n                      fig.path = \"myfigs/\",\n                      dev = c(\"pdf\", \"png\"))\n```\n\n\nfigure output per code block\nYou can set the options for remaining code blocks individually. These will overrule the default options that you specify in the setup chunk.\n```{r figurename, fig.width =5, fig.height =7}\n\n# some code that generates a figure\n\n```"

    "text": "tables\nThere are several useful (incredible even) packages for making tables in R. Here are a few:\n\nknitr package and it’s kable function (Create tables in Latex, HTML, Markdown)\nxtable package, lots of functions for tables. Here are some xtable examples xtable\nkableExtra lots of additional table functionality\ntangram a grammar of tables approach\npapaja for apa-style tables\n\n\nImportant table info\nTwo things to note, tables can be difficult, and there are different output formats.\n\nTables in R can be difficult. For example, if you are comfortable with making tables in Excel, then R will be much more difficult by comparison. In Excel, it is easy to enter information in any cell, merge any cells, add any kind of formatting you want anywhere, just by clicking around and making the changes. In R, every detail of the table is specified by script. Some of the table packages make simple tables easy (hurray!), and some of them make complicated tables possible (also good), but not necessarilly easy.\nR can output tables in many formats including HTML for the web, Latex for .pdf, and other formats (e.g., word, markdown). Sometimes (depending on the functions you are using) you will run into issues with outputting tables in different formats. Or, you will have to take steps to ensure that you are outputting the table in the format that you want.\n\n\n\nknitr::kable\nkable() is a function inside the knitr package. To use it you need to load the knitr library, or you can use knitr::kable(), which tells R to find kable inside the knitr package if you haven’t loaded knitr using library(knitr).\nkable() is great for quickly rendering data frames as nice tables without much hassle.\n\ndf <- data.frame(A=1,\n                 B=2,\n                 C=3,\n                 D=4)\nknitr::kable(df)\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxtable\nLook at the xtable examples document for more info. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf\n\nlibrary(xtable) # load xtable\ndata(tli) # loads a sample data frame\n\n# conduct an ANOVA\n fm1 <- aov(tlimth ~ sex + ethnicty + grade + disadvg, data = tli)\n \n# print the table for HTML using xtable and kable together\nknitr::kable(xtable(fm1))\n\n\n\n\n\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nsex\n1\n75.37255\n75.37255\n0.3751912\n0.5416830\n\n\nethnicty\n3\n2572.14918\n857.38306\n4.2679008\n0.0071831\n\n\ngrade\n1\n36.30740\n36.30740\n0.1807318\n0.6717271\n\n\ndisadvg\n1\n59.30338\n59.30338\n0.2952017\n0.5882062\n\n\nResiduals\n93\n18682.86749\n200.89105\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n# Note this will print a table in latex for .pdf\n# xtable(fm1)\n\n\n\nkableExtra\nThere are many great things about kableExtra.

    "text": "Vectorized approaches\nLoops are a common tool for doing something many times. R can accomplish the goal of “doing something many times” without loops, using a vectorized approach.\n\nBasic examples\nLet’s take a close look at some very basic differences between using a loop, and using R’s vectorized approach\nConsider the problem of adding a single number to all of the numbers in a vector.\n\nnums <- c(1,2,3,4)\n\n# vectorized approach\n# R automatically adds 1 to all of the numbers\nnums+1\n#> [1] 2 3 4 5\n\n# loop approach\n# much longer to write out\nfor(i in 1:length(nums)){\n  nums[i] <- nums[i]+1\n}\nnums\n#> [1] 2 3 4 5\n\nHow about adding two vectors together, so we add the first two numbers together, then the second two numbers etc.\n\nA <- c(1,2,3,4)\nB <- c(1,2,3,4)\n\n# vectorized approach\nA+B\n#> [1] 2 4 6 8\n\n# loop approach\nthe_sum <-c()\nfor(i in 1:length(A)){\n  the_sum[i] <- A[i]+B[i]\n}\nthe_sum\n#> [1] 2 4 6 8\n\nHow about comparing the identity of the elements in two vectors to see if they are the same or not?\n\nA <- c(\"c\",\"e\",\"f\",\"g\")\nB <- c(\"d\",\"e\",\"f\",\"g\")\n\n#vectorized approach\nA==B\n#> [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# loop approach\ncompared <-c()\nfor(i in 1:length(A)){\n  if(A[i]==B[i]){\n    compared[i] <- TRUE\n  } else {\n    compared[i] <- FALSE\n  }\n}\ncompared\n#> [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\nReplicate\nreplicate(n, expr) allows you to repeat a function many times, and return the answer in a vector\n\n# returns 1 randomly sampled number from 1 to 10\nsample(1:10,1)\n#> [1] 9\n\n# let's repeat the above 10 times using replicate\nreplicate(10,sample(1:10,1))\n#>  [1]  3  4  8 10  8  1  9  3  3  9\n\nThe next example shows how to write a function to do something, and then use the function inside replicate to repeat the function many times.\nFor example, we write a function to run a one-sample t-test on a random sample drawn from a normal distribution\n\nttest_result <- function(){\n  sample <- rnorm(10,0,1)\n  t_out <- t.test(sample, mu=0)\n  return(t_out$statistic)\n}\n\n# get 10 t-values from repeating the above 10 times\nreplicate(10, ttest_result() )\n#>          t          t          t          t          t          t          t \n#>  1.5612562  0.2534267 -0.1194978 -1.3654999  1.7448848  1.9904660  0.6604283 \n#>          t          t          t \n#> -0.3031843 -0.1356073  1.1521186\n\n\n\napply family\nThe apply family of functions can be used to “apply” a function across elements of an object. A general overview can be found here\nSome of the apply functions include: apply(), lapply, and sapply.\n\n\nlapply and sapply\nHere is part of the definition of lapply from the help file:\nlapply returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.\nLet’s see some examples:\nLet’s apply a function to each of the elements in a vector. To keep things simple, our function will add 1 to a number\n\nsome_numbers <- c(1,2,3,4)\n\nadd_one <- function(x){\n  return(x+1)\n}\n\n# returns a list, containing the answers\nlapply(some_numbers, add_one)\n#> [[1]]\n#> [1] 2\n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#> [1] 3\n#> \n#> [[3]]\n#> [1] 4\n#> \n#> [[4]]\n#> [1] 5\n\n# unlists the list\nunlist(lapply(some_numbers,add_one))\n#> [1] 2 3 4 5\n\n# sapply does the unlisting for you\nsapply(some_numbers, add_one)\n#> [1] 2 3 4 5\n\nAn alternative syntax for lapply and sapply let’s you define the function you want to apply inside the lapply or sapply function.\nIn this case, each element in the vector some_numbers will become the x value in the function.\n\nsome_numbers <- c(1,2,3,4)\n\nlapply(some_numbers, FUN = function(x){x+1})\n#> [[1]]\n#> [1] 2\n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#> [1] 3\n#> \n#> [[3]]\n#> [1] 4\n#> \n#> [[4]]\n#> [1] 5\nsapply(some_numbers, FUN = function(x){x+1})\n#> [1] 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\napply\nThe apply function can be used on 2-dimensional data, and allows you to apply a function across the rows or the columns of the data.\nLet’s say you had a 5x5 matrix of random numbers. Let’s find the sum of each row\n\nrandom_matrix <- matrix(sample(1:10,25, replace=TRUE),ncol=5)\n\n# applies the sum function to each row\n# 1 tells apply to go across rows\napply(random_matrix,1,sum)\n#> [1] 27 31 16 22 30\n\nThe sum of each column\n\n# applies the sum function to each column\n# 2 tells apply to go across columns\napply(random_matrix, 2, sum)\n#> [1] 35 23 16 27 25\n\nLet’s say we have a matrix storing 3 samples. Each sample has 10 numbers. Each sample is stored in a column, and each row represents an observation.\n\nsample_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(30,0,1),ncol=3)\n\nLet’s use apply to conduct 10 one-sample t-tests, one for each column. In this example, we can pass the mu=0 parameter into the t.test function. However, we will return the entire ouput of each t-test in a list.\n\napply(sample_matrix,2,t.test, mu=0)\n#> [[1]]\n#> \n#>  One Sample t-test\n#> \n#> data:  newX[, i]\n#> t = 1.8514, df = 9, p-value = 0.09713\n#> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  -0.1600968  1.6033854\n#> sample estimates:\n#> mean of x \n#> 0.7216443 \n#> \n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#> \n#>  One Sample t-test\n#> \n#> data:  newX[, i]\n#> t = -1.6456, df = 9, p-value = 0.1342\n#> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  -1.5290346  0.2412294\n#> sample estimates:\n#>  mean of x \n#> -0.6439026 \n#> \n#> \n#> [[3]]\n#> \n#>  One Sample t-test\n#> \n#> data:  newX[, i]\n#> t = 0.44505, df = 9, p-value = 0.6668\n#> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  -0.711284  1.059703\n#> sample estimates:\n#> mean of x \n#> 0.1742094\n\nWhat if we wanted to return only the t-values, rather than whole output?\nYou might try this, but it doesn’t work\n\napply(sample_matrix,2,t.test$statistic, mu=0)\n#> Error in t.test$statistic: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n\nSo, we write a custom function\n\napply(sample_matrix, 2, \n      FUN = function(x){\n        t_out <- t.test(x,mu=0)\n        return(t_out$statistic)\n      })\n#> [1]  1.8514197 -1.6456404  0.4450502"

If you make changes AND save your changes, then the previous state of the file is erased and replaced with the new version of the file.\nVersion control systems allow a user to go back to previous versions of a file. Imagine you were writing a paper in a microsoft word and you saved it several times as you went along. If you were using version control you would be able to go back and see the version of the document at each saved state.\nSome cloud services automatically have version control. For example, dropbox.com uses version control, and if you have saved and changed files in a dropbox folder, then it is possible to go back to previous versions of the file.\nVersion control is used by software developers and coders for many reasons, including to organize and keep track of project development, but also to be able to go back to previous versions of a project or code base."

At the same time, there are som comparatively simple ways to use the system and get benefits from it without being pro git users right away.\nGit is a software library you install on your local computer. This software will allow you to create “git-enabled” folders with version control. When you make changes in these folder AND save your changes using a commit message, you will be able to go back to any previous saved state.\nThere are multiple ways to enable any folder as a git folder. We will usually do this using R studio. Whenever we create a new R studio project folder, if you have git properly installed, you will be able to choose an option to initialize as a git folder. It is possible to turn a folder into a git folder later on too using other methods.\nGithub desktop is a free program we will use to easily work with a git folder. We use this program to locate git folders on our computer (build a list of them for easy access.) When we make changes to files in a git folder, then Github desktop is used to commit the changes. This involves writing a short title or message describing the changes, and then “committing” them. This is all point and click. You can also view the history of all previously committed changes in Github desktop.\nEverything so far is all local to your own computer. We will also be using Github.com as a cloud service to publicly (or privately) share code on the internet. Github desktop is a program that let’s us do a few things with Github.com:\n\nPublish a local git folder to a Github.com repository\n\n\nYou will be able to go to your Github.com account and view the published folder there\n\n\nMake changes to your files on your local computer, commit your changes with a message, then push them to github.com so that the cloud repository will be updated.\nIf you change something in your repository on github.com, then you can “pull” your changes back.\nIt’s also possible to manage collaborations with other people."

    "section": "Data science in a box",
    "text": "Data science in a box\nThere are many great free resources on the web for learning data skills with R. This example comes from data science in a box.\nhttps://datasciencebox.org\nThis whole course is built using quarto, the same tool we will use for our blogs.\nThere are different approaches to learning R from scratch. One approach is start with all of the fundamental building blocks of coding, and then slowly move into much higher level tasks for data analysis, like learning how to use functions for data-visualization. Another approach is to begin with a hands-on example of using R for reproducible data-analysis and visualization.\nNOTE: “Reproducible” is an important concept we will emphasize throughout the course. For now a “reproducible” analysis means that other people can re-do the same analysis that you did and get the same results.\nIn class we will look at the “First dataviz” example from the hello world section:\nhttps://datasciencebox.org/02-hello-world.html\n\nInstructions\nGOAL: Our big goal here is to reproduce the data-visualization from this example on our own computer using R Studio, and then talk about what we are looking at.\n\nOpen Rstudio\nMake a new project\n\n\n\nUnder the file menu, select “New project”, or click the top-right corner of R studio (with the blue R cube), and choose New Project.\nIMPORTANT: You should almost always be working inside an R studio project. We will talk more about this in class.\nChoose “New Directory”\nChoose “New Project”\nCreate a name, and choose where to save it, e.g. “datavis1”\nClick “Create project”\n\n\n\nYou can confirm you are now in an R studio project by looking at the top right hand corner, you should see a blue cube with the name of your project.\n\n\nThis is what an empty R studio project looks like. The bottom right corner shows you the folder for your current project. There is only one file “datavis1.Rproj”. If you click on this file from your filesystem (e.g., in finder on a mac, or in explorer or my computer on windows), then it will load Rstudio and this project.\n\nCreate a new quarto document. Click the green circle with a plus, choose new “Quarto document”.\n\n\nGive your document a title.\n\nClick the “Render” Button. Then save your document in your R project folder.\nIMPORTANT. The title of your document can be different from the name of the file. You should change the file name from “Untitled.qmd” to something more descriptive like “datavis_example.qmd”, and then press save.\nAfter saving and rendering the document you will see the html (web-page) output. The file doesn’t have any text or analysis code, so it will appear mostly blank.\n\nThe datascience in a box course has an example data analysis and visualization that we should be able to reproduce on our computers.\nThis example shows a short data-analysis report that conducts a visualization of United Nations voting data for different countries.\nThe source code for this report is available here:\nhttps://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/main/course-materials/application-exercises/ae-01a-un-votes/unvotes.qmd\n\nCopy the plain text from line 1 to line 92, and then paste it into your own .qmd document. Make sure you replace all of your original text. Save your .qmd document.\nRstudio may ask you to install some missing packages, click the install option.\nOnce the packages are installed, then you should be able to render the document. And, you should see something like this.\n\n\nWe are going to cover the rest in class. If you missed class you can try the videos about this content on datascience in a\nhttps://datasciencebox.org/02-hello-world.html\nThe first two videos are probably most helpful and similar to what we will discuss in class.\nFinally, I created a folder called examples in the gihthub repository for this course. This example is located in the “datavis1” folder. You can also download this folder and access its contents as another method to try the example:\nhttps://github.com/CrumpLab/psyc3470/tree/master/examples"

This is a class that involves learning computer programming skills for data-visualization and analysis. The assumption is that students may possess no prior skills in this area, so the course has an applied training component. Class time will involve mixtures of activities, including lectures, group-work, applied coding activities, presentations, and discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDate\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nW0 M:\nJanuary 25, 2023\nIntroduction\n\n\nW1 M:\nJanuary 30, 2023\nIntroduction\n\n\nW1 W:\nFebruary 1, 2023\nIntro to R and Rstudio\n\n\nW2 M:\nFebruary 6, 2023\nIntro to R and Rstudio\n\n\nW2 W:\nFebruary 8, 2023\nReports with R Markdown\n\n\nNo class - College Closed\nFebruary 13, 2023\n\n\n\nW3 W:\nFebruary 15, 2023\nReports with R Markdown\n\n\nNo class - College closed\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\n\n\nW4 T(M):\nFebruary 21, 2023\nData Visualisation\n\n\nW4 W:\nFebruary 22, 2023\nData Visualisation\n\n\nW5 M:\nFebruary 27, 2023\nData Import\n\n\nW5 W:\nMarch 1, 2023\nData Import\n\n\nW6 M:\nMarch 6, 2023\nData Summaries\n\n\nW6 W:\nMarch 8, 2023\nData Summaries\n\n\nW7 M:\nMarch 13, 2023\nPractice Report\n\n\nW7 W:\nMarch 15, 2023\nPractice Report\n\n\nW8 M:\nMarch 20, 2023\nData Relations\n\n\nW8 W:\nMarch 22, 2023\nData Relations\n\n\nW9 M:\nMarch 27, 2023\nData Tidying\n\n\nW9 W:\nMarch 29, 2023\nData Tidying\n\n\nW10 M:\nApril 3, 2023\nFinal Project Planning\n\n\nSpring Break\nApril 5, 2023\n\n\n\nSpring Break\nApril 12, 2023\n\n\n\nW11 M:\nApril 17, 2023\nData Wrangling\n\n\nW11 W:\nApril 19, 2023\nData Wrangling\n\n\nW12 M:\nApril 24, 2023\nCustomising Visualizations & Reports\n\n\nW12 W:\nApril 26, 2023\nCustomising Visualizations & Reports\n\n\nW13 M:\nMay 1, 2023\nAdvanced Quarto & Shiny\n\n\nW13 W:\nMay 3, 2023\nAdvanced Quarto & Shiny\n\n\nW14 M:\nMay 8, 2023\nAdvanced Quarto & Shiny\n\n\nW14 W:\nMay 10, 2023\nAdvanced Quarto & Shiny\n\n\nReading Day\nMay 12, 2023\n\n\n\nW15 M:\nMay 15, 2023\nFinal Presentations\n\n\nLast day of classes\nMay 16, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this course you will learn how to analyse and communicate data using reproducible computational methods. These methods allow you to communicate information in many formats including websites, interactive web apps, slide decks, pdfs, word documents, books, web-books, and more. Students can use these very same methods to create their own personal websites, which can be used as a digital portfolio to showcase examples of their work and demonstrate their skills. To support digital portfolio development, students will learn to create a personal website and blog. Students will add content to their websites in the form of blogs and other weekly assignment content prompts. By the end of the course students will have created evidence of their learning process in the form of their course website and blog. Students can choose to share their coursework publicly or privately. For more information on see notes on privacy and sharing in the compendium.\n\n\n\nThis is an engagement and skills-acquisition based course. At the beginning of the course and throughout, students will be given instruction on building and maintaining a website using quarto and github pages. Each week students will contribute blog posts and other content to their websites in response to module assignments. Students will be expected to submit URL links to their blogs using Blackboard. Students are expected to attend and participate in each class. The final project includes conducting, communicating, and preserving a reproducible data analysis project.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPoints\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nCourse blog/website\n5\n5\n\n\nWeekly Blog post\n4\n60\n\n\nAttendance\n1\n15\n\n\nMidterm project\n10\n10\n\n\nFinal Project\n10\n10\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\nPercentage grades are converted to letter grades according to the following rubric.\n\n\n\nLetter grade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA+\n96.67-100\n\n\nA\n93.33-96.66\n\n\nA-\n90-93.32\n\n\nB+\n86.67-89.99\n\n\nB\n83.33-86.66\n\n\nB-\n80-83.32\n\n\nC+\n76.67-79.99\n\n\nC\n73-76.66\n\n\nC-\n70-72.99\n\n\nD+\n66.67-69.99\n\n\nD\n63.33-66.66\n\n\nD-\n60-63.32\n\n\nF\n0-59.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to attend and participate in each class.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue dates are suggestions for completing coursework on a weekly basis. You may be able to work ahead, but you are not encouraged to fall behind.\nYou should email me if you have an exceptional circumstance preventing you from taking an assessment during an assessment week.\n\n\n\nThe syllabus may be updated for clarity or to make adjustments for pedagogical purposes. The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\n\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.\nIf you have questions please email me:\n\nput PSYC 3470 in your subject line\nemail me at: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n\n\n\n\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of each student to understand and act in accordance with the University’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nThe faculty and administration of Brooklyn College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found at this site. If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.\n\n\n\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CUNY’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\n\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about the syllabus, let’s talk about it in class, and/or please create a thread to discuss the question on the discussion board for this course on Blackboard."
